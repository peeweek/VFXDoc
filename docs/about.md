# About VFXDoc

### Who are you?

My name is [Thomas Ich√©](https://peeweek.net).

I do real-time VFX for a living since 2008 and I have worked on several projects: I Am Alive (Ubisoft), Remember Me (Capcom), Life is Strange (Square Enix).

I am currently working at Unity Technologies, making the Visual Effect Graph. I am concerned by my tools in order to make cool and optimized effects. To achieve that, I am willing to improve my knowledge, tools and workflow so nothing gets in the way of creativity.

I can also write code and scripts.

### Why do you do this for free?

I think knowledge has only value when it's transmitted between peers. Knowledge kept is often necessary among people and studios for strategic reasons.

However, there is always a time for people to let it out and confront these ideas to other people's knowledge and ideas. That's when new ideas show up and the community can go on.

I have spent 10 years learning a lot from others, giving others fruit of my findings and sharing experience together with awesome people.

Now it is time I share it with you.

### How can I thank you?

I think the best way is to drop me a word either on Twitter, LinkedIn or drop me an e-mail. I am a bit busy lately so do not hate me if I do not answer quickly.

If you still feel the need to give me something I do not accept money but still you can send me postcards, beers. or if you are a game or a tool developer, send me your creation! 

You can also throw an eye on my [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/peeweek/#sort=order), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/u/peeweek/wishlist), [Instant Gaming](https://www.instant-gaming.com/user/gamer-b096db) or [Amazon](http://amzn.eu/4T0qApE) wish lists.

### You are wrong about (insert topic here)

And you are probably right. Everything you will find here is the fruit of my own experience but I do not claim to have the absolute truth. I tried my best to verify the information I wrote on this documentation but sometimes I can either do mistakes by writing or being totally off track. 

In this case I'd be glad if you can drop me a word about this. And I would try to correct it on the website
