# Shaders

Welcome to the shaders section of VFX Documentation. in this section, you will find articles in relationship to authoring shaders in node-based tools, or code directly, either technical, workflows or artistic tricks.



## Technical Concepts

* [Shaders Overview](overview.md) : The different types of Shaders and How they work in a GPU.
* [Color](color.md) management in a game engine. LDR and HDR concepts. Gamma and Linear Rendering
* Technical introduction to [HLSL](hlsl.md) , the GPU shader language (with a [HLSL CheatSheet](hlslcheatsheet.md))
* A bunch of [HLSL Utility Snippets](utility.md) 

## Workflows

* [Alpha Erosion](alpha-erosion.md) Methods and Workflows.
* [Dot Product](dotproduct.md) math operations and their useful practical cases.
* [Fading](fading.md) pixels and alpha based on various criteria.
* [UV and Texture Coordinate](texcoord.md) useful operations (scrolling, deformation, gradient mapping,...)
* Shaders for Simulating [Volumetric Lights and fog](volumetric.md)
