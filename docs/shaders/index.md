# Shaders

Welcome to the shaders section of VFX Documentation. in this section, you will find articles in relationship to authoring shaders in node-based tools, or code directly, either technical, workflows or artistic tricks.

## General Concepts

* [Why using Shaders?](purpose.md) A non-exhaustive list of purposes and Use Cases for shaders.

## Technical Concepts

* [Shaders : Technical Overview](overview.md) : The different types of Shaders and How they work in a GPU.
* [Color Management](color.md) in shaders and game engines : LDR and HDR concepts. Gamma and Linear Rendering
* Technical introduction to [HLSL](hlsl.md) , the GPU shader language (with a [HLSL CheatSheet](hlslcheatsheet.md))

## Workflows

* [Alpha Erosion](alpha-erosion.md) Workflows : how to dissolve alpha masks efficiently.
* [Dot Product](dotproduct.md) math operations and their useful practical cases.
* [Fading](fading.md) pixels and alpha based on various criteria.
* [Manipulating Texture Coordinates (UVs)](texcoord.md) useful workflows (scrolling, deformation, flow maps, gradient mapping,...)
* Shaders for Simulating [Volumetric Lights and fog](volumetric.md)

* A bunch of [HLSL & Graph Utility Snippets](utility.md)
